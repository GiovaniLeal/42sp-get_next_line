    <b>get_next_line</b> is a function that reads a line from a file descriptor. It allows you to retrieve the next line from a file, one line at a time, without having to read the entire file at once. The function is designed to be memory efficient and to work seamlessly with multiple file descriptors.

This project is part of the curriculum at 42 school and is aimed at enhancing your understanding of file manipulation, memory allocation, and static variables.
